# 'Follina' Microsoft Office RCE

Quick POC to replicate the 'Follina' Office RCE vulnerability for local testing purposes. Running the script will generate the `clickme.docx` payload file in your current working directory, and start a web server with the payload file (`www/exploit.html`). Will run on localhost by default, modify parameters in `follina.py` as needed.

As far as I'm aware the file that is executed needs to end in `.exe`, but you can load it from a remote file share to farm some hashes if you want.
